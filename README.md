# IndianLiverDisease-Diagnosis-MLproject

Developed a machine learning model to classify whether a person has liver disease based on medical data.

This project focuses on diagnosing liver disease using machine learning classification models, specifically Random Forest and Logistic Regression. The dataset used is the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset

The Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) is used for this project. It can be found at:
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset)](<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset)>)

## Project Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict the likelihood of liver disease in patients based on various medical attributes. The main steps include:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
5. Model evaluation and comparison

## Features

- Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- Handling of missing values
- Feature encoding
- Correlation analysis
- Implementation of Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Prediction on new data

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script

## Results

The project compares the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest models in diagnosing liver disease. Detailed results and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
